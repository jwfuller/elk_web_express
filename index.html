            Hi, I am James Fuller. I am apply for the Digital Marketing Developer position. I am going to talk about operating a WaaS (Websites as a Service) that currently runs more than 1200 instances of Drupal across 4 environments and more than 60 servers.

            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>Provide a free service to campus that allows non-techincal users to build modern, brand complaint and accessible websites</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Promise to the users was 'No software to install, no servers to manag, no HTML skills needed. No technical requirements.'

              <li class="fragment">The service quickly <strong>exceeded</strong> its target of 30 websites</li>
              <li class="fragment">And then the two senior developers took new jobs....</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              The service was originally designed to handle 30 websites, we were already up to 130; more than 4 times the original scope. Following the unexpected departure of 40% of the team; I was asked to take on the operations role.

              <li class="fragment">Legacy code base to orchestrate service
                <ul class="fragment">
                  <li>Nearly no documentation</li>
                  <li>Limited functionality</li>
                  <li>Accepted routine outages as part of the service</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="fragment">New requirements
                <ul class="fragment">
                  <li>Need to support rapid growth</li>
                  <li>Need to support high profile sites (routine outages are no longer acceptable)</li>
                  <li>Need to deploy unique combinations of code to select instances</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              Code base created new instances and launched them at their final URLs. Code for websites deployed as a monolith and updated via a very manual process. Result is that all instances where impacted as soon as we began updates. This meant that the last instance in the list could be down for hours while updates processed on the other websites. It was written in a mix of Python, Shell scripts, and adhoc commands in text files. There was also very limited logging and error handling; processes had to be run several times to complete.

              We where expecting to double in size in the next year; including taking on the homepage and college level websites. In addition, we where now rapidly producing code that was only intended for handfuls of instances at a time, we needed a way to deploy additional code to them and only them.

              I developed this in four months while keeping the lights on for the rest of the service. This was a complete re-write of all the functionality in the legacy code base, these new features, and dozen of other bug fixes. We also added support for the centralized logging system that I deployed during this time.

              <li class="fragment">Added integration into Slack</li>

            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              Released 10 months after 1.0. Included another rewrite, I was learning python through out this entire time. James with 2 months of Python experience didn't always make the best decisions.

              <li class="fragment">Program can now run operational commands on arbitary sets of instances</li>
              <li class="fragment">Added support to backup instances that have been updated</li>

            <aside class="notes">
              We run drush commands on any query-able set of instances. If an instance is editted during the day, it is backed up that night.

            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">In my first year running operations, the platform added 222 instances</li>
              <li class="fragment">Deployment speed has not increased despite 10x growth in 3.5 years</li>
              <li class="fragment">Support deployment of more than 50 code repositories</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
                In my second year, we added 170 instances. The year after that, 150 instances and in the last 3 months, 400 instances. We are now over 1200 instance across all of our environments.

                I run operations for a service that has grown by 2 orders of magnitude and we have no had a drop off in performance from our orchestration layer.
